 Predict fraudulent transactions 

It is important that credit card companies are able to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions so that customers are not charged for items that they did not purchase. In this assignment, you will
experiment with different classifers on the binary classifcation problem of anomaly detection in credit card transactions. The dataset described below contains transactions that occurred in a two day period. Due to
confdentiality issues, the background information about the features will not be described. You only know that the first attribute describes the dollar amount in the transaction and the class output is either 0 for
normal or 1 for fraud
